### Image Posting Board project.

The focus of this preject is geared towards CRUD operation on non-relational database and handling post and get requests through forms.

+ This image board allows the user to load threee images (Client has to provide url to the images) at once and put them inside an album. This way the client can create many albums which are all displayed on the homepage. The client can go inside an album to see the pictures it contains by clicking on the album title.

+ Upon clicking on an album, the application redirects to a page that contains all the related pictures. From there, the user can add more pictures and deleted one or more pictures at once. The application esp. it's data updates accordingly after picture addition/deletion.
